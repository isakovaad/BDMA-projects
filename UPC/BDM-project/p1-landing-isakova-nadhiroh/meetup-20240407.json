You do NOT need to know anything about art history to deeply enjoy this novel. Author Elizabeth Freemantle envelops us in the sights, sounds, and smells of 17th-century Rome. This is fiction, but it is based upon the events of the shocking and astonishing real-life story of Artemisia Gentileschi. The immense amount of historical research is worn lightly but has a vivid impact. It may be hard for us to fully understand the extreme limitations placed on female artists for so long. Artemisia Gentileschi, born in 1593, had access to the art world through her father, the Tuscan painter Orazio Gentileschi. She was influenced by Carravagio (known as Merisi in the novel). All women at the time faced huge obstacles to get their work seen, and Artemisia Gentileschi was no different. Not only that, but she was determined to paint from the female perspective, something very new. edited summary from DailyArt magazine",

Ha estat investigador al Centre Internacional de Mètodes Numèrics en Enginyeria i ha treballat al detector d’ones gravitacionals VIRGO a Itàlia. Actualment és professor d’enginyeria a Elisava i dirigeix Spacetime Syndicate, empresa dedicada a la creació d’experiències immersives relacionades amb la ciència. Ha realitzat la seva tesi de màster a IFAE, utilitzant mètodes d'intel·ligència artificial per a la detecció d’ones gravitacionals. Resum : En aquesta xerrada apta per a principiants explicarem com Einstein va postular l'existencia de ones gravitacionals a partir de la teoria de la relativitat general (mostrarem alguna formula que mai fa mal). Explorarem les implicacions i interpretacions d'aquests resultats i discutirem els sofisticats aparells utilitzats per a la seva detecció experimental. Per afegir un toc personal, l'autor comparirà la seva experiències a l'observatori gravitacional Virgo, de Pisa. --------------------------------------- A Sopa de Partícules hem creat un TAULELL D'AUNCIS . És purament per estar informat de primera mà de les coses que anem fent, com xerrades, esdeveniments, sopars, sortides (del tipus NAUKAS, CERN..). És només d'una via (per llegir). Ningú més pot opinar. Si vols estar al dia, apuntat. https://t.me/sopadeparticulas",

  "description": "After 4 years (we can't quite believe it's been that long) since our last onsite event, we are thrilled to be back on Thursday 4th April for our next DevOps Exchange Barcelona event! Hosted in Sant Martí by our good friends at Veriff , we are officially back with a great line-up in store for you, as we welcome to the stage talks from; leading entertainment provider Viaplay Group , IT service management company Allianz Technology and our hosts at Veriff . First up on stage we welcome Pablo Bouzad from Viaplay Group who will dive into what he sees as the most critical factors and common issues when an organisation tries to change its culture, why organisations or employees refuse to accept the change and how to work with them and alter their perspective. Next up, we have Pere Alcoberro from Allianz Technology who will discuss why you would want to migrate to Crossplane, including use-cases, the adoption curve, and how it works now in Allianz Technology. Finally, Ricard Borràs Navarra from our hosts at Veriff will delve into how they deploy computer vision models by leveraging a mix of classic software engineering techniques combined with the latest AWS tooling. Doors will open at 6:30pm with talks starting at 7pm. There will be 3 x 20 minute talks followed by a Q & A session. Refreshments will be provided, courtesy of Veriff! For this event we have a limit on capacity, so if you're interested in attending please RSVP as soon as possible to avoid missing out. Please amend your RSVP if you can no longer make it, to free up the space for someone else. Agenda: 7:00pm: Pablo Bouzada , Software Engineering Manager @ Viaplay Group \"Culture really matters\" DevOps is not a product you can buy and set up. It is not a process or framework you choose to follow up. Building microservice applications neither means you are doing DevOps. You can’t be DevOps and traditional; there’s no cherry-picking, requires a change in the whole organisation's CULTURE. The culture of an organisation is the way in which things are done, the behaviours, values and practices that have been developed and reinforced over time. Culture has a big impact on the way things are done inside an organisation and is the more important factor in innovation levels and the improvement of products and processes. In this talk we will see what are the most critical factors when an organisation try to change its culture, which are common issues, why some organisations or persons refuse to accept the change... and how to work with them. Bio: With over 15 years of hands-on experience in programming, Pablo is a seasoned professional who has successfully transitioned into leadership roles, currently serving as an Engineering Manager in international companies. 7:20pm: Pere Alcoberro , DevOps Architect @ Allianz Technology \"Terraform to Crossplane, Our Journey\" Why we want to migrate to Crossplane, use-cases, the adoption curve, and how it works now in Allianz Technology. Bio: Cloud & DevOps Architect and Team Lead in Allianz Technology. 7:40pm: Ricard Borràs Navarra , Staff machine learning engineer @ Veriff \"Deploying Machine Learning models at scale without DevOps help\" This talk will explain how we deploy computer vision models at Veriff by leveraging a mix of classic software engineering techniques combined with the latest AWS tooling. I will explain how we cut down our model deployment time from 10 days to 1 day and inference costs by 75%. Bio: I have a strong background in computer vision and leadership in complex AI projects, turning research projects into practical solutions. My expertise encompasses AWS, Python, MLOps, PyTorch, and computer vision. *Please note that attendees will be required to sign an NDA upon entering the event venue. We hope that you are able to join us for this event! We are back running regular events in Barcelona, so if you are unable to make this specific event, keep an eye on our Meetup page for our next event, coming soon.

Un retrat, un silenci, un petit (o gran) drama generacional ple d’ironia i, per què no, d’humor. Cinc persones (o cinquanta) condemnades a esperar. Puntualment sembla que sí, que… Però no, segueixen esperant. Esperen poder trobar una feina, que arribi el moment adequat per tenir un fill, que els arribi l’amor, que puguin emancipar-se: esperen poder començar a viure la seva vida. Esperen poder començar a viure la seva vida, mentre la vida els passa pel davant, inexorablement. Aconsegueix ja la teva entrada per gaudir d’aquesta peça tan especial! NOTA DE L’AUTOR (Roger Simeon) Personatges sense nom ni característiques que podrien ser, que som (de manera més o menys directe) jo i els meus amics i contemporanis. Som tots aquells que vam créixer en la frugalitat dels 90 i sota les promeses d’un futur brillant fins que vam topar amb el gran mur d’aquesta realitat imposada. Ens comparàvem amb els nostres pares i volíem ser millors que ells, ho volíem tenir tot i viure-ho tot, però hem fracassat estrepitosament en la gran majoria de les nostres aventures. Nosaltres no ens hem pogut comprar una casa als 25 anys, ni tenir una feina estable, ni viure en una progressió ascendent. De fet, molts no hem pogut ni seguir vivint al nostre país. Som adults a qui no ens han permès créixer i ens ho mirem tot amb sorna i ironia perquè sinó la patacada seria massa gran. No hem superat els nostres pares, potser hem tirat 50 anys enrere. Però tots tenim una cosa en comú: hem hagut de posar en pausa les nostres vides i, en el millors dels casos, endarrerir-ho tot uns quants anys. I així seguim.

Andorra is easily accessible from Barcelona and some of the best skiing in Europe. Everyone is welcome, come on your own or with friends. We will use a ski tour company to organise the trip (details to follow), this meetup group is so that we can organise to go together regularly. The trip will include bus from Barcelona to Andorra, bus to and from the slopes on Saturday and Sunday, 2 nights hotel accommodation and 2 day ski passes. Some food will also be included: breakfast and dinner on the Saturday and Breakfast on the Sunday. The cost is €264 and we will be staying at the Hotel Coray in encamp, Andorra. Whats included: • Bus to Andorra Friday at 20.00 h (departure at 8pm from Palau Reial (https://www.google.es/maps/search/palau+reial/@41.3867274,2.1211402,16.79z?hl=en)) • 2 night in double bedroom (breakfast & dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday) • 2 day ski pass in Grandvalira (the biggest and best resort in Andorra) • Bus to and from ski slopes Saturday and Sunday • Bus back to Barcelona I need final numbers as soon as possible!

  "description": "ESP | Plazas limitadas. Grupo intimo de 6 personas max. Imprescindible RESERVAR por WHATSAPP +34 604 370 276 🙏 La energía vital o Kundalini es la fuerza creadora divina que está en nosotros y a nuestro alrededor. Es la que da forma y vida a todo lo que existe. Reconectarse a ella y dejar que se exprese libremente es muchas veces el inicio de un proceso transformador de evolución personal. Se liberan emociones reprimidas, limitaciones y bloqueos que hemos acumulado a lo largo de la vida y que nos impiden ser quienes realmente somos. Se abre entonces la posibilidad de vivir con más autenticidad y coherencia, alineados a nuestra verdadera esencia. Durante las sesiones se crea una conexión entre la energía universal, los participantes y la facilitadora. Abrimos un espacio seguro, un campo energético dónde podemos entrar en resonancia con esta fuerza vital y activarla dentro de nosotros. Este proceso requiere de entrar en un estado de rendición, de confianza y apertura, permitiendo que sea la energía misma que guie la experiencia. Cómo es una sesión? Al principio de la sesión, te invito a estirarte en posición de Savasana (posición de relajación en yoga) con los ojos cerrados. Una playlist de un poco más de una hora estará sonando, ayudándote a entrar en un estado meditativo consciente. Yo estaré acompañando a cada uno en su proceso, ofreciendo un sostén energético y a veces una presencia más física con toques puntuales en diferentes partes del cuerpo. Cada sesión es única. La energía actúa de manera diferente en cada persona, acorde a lo que se necesite en el momento y siempre de manera segura y consciente. A veces se manifiesta de manera más obvia, con movimientos físicos espontáneos, espasmos, sensaciones corporales diversas o emociones, y otras veces de manera más interna o introspectiva con visiones, sensaciones de paz y de calma, intuición, lucidez.... Que te puede aportar? Aquí te dejo algunos beneficios que se puede experimentar con las activaciones energéticas: Mayor vitalidad Liberación de emociones y bloqueos Empoderamiento Estado de paz y claridad mental Mayor presencia y conexión contigo mismo Expansión de la consciencia Mayor intuición y creatividad Despertar de la energía sexual No dudes en contactarme si tienes alguna pregunta o si deseas más información! @sandra_inresonance *** ENG | Limited places. Intimate group of 6 people max. Indispensable CONFIRMING through WHATSAPP +34 604 370 276 🙏 Life force energy or Kundalini is the divine creative force that is within and all around us; the force that gives form and life to everything in existence. Reconnecting to this powerful energy and letting it express itself and move freely is often the beginning of a deep transformative process of personal evolution. Stuck emotions, limitations and blockages that we have been accumulating throughout life and that prevent us from being who we really are, are gradually released. This liberating process opens us to the possibility of leading a more authentic and coherent life, in alignment with our true essence. During the sessions a beautiful connection is weaved between the Universal energy, the participants and the facilitator. We create a safe space, an energetic field where the possibility of resonating with this vital force and activating it within opens up. It is best to approach this process from a place of surrender and trust, allowing space for the energy itself to guide your experience. What happens in a session? At the beginning of the session, I invite you to lie down on your mat in Savasana (posture of relaxation in yoga), eyes closed while you start listening to a playlist that will last for about an hour. Music plays an important role in these sessions, helping the mind surrender and enter into a deeper meditative state. I will be assisting each person in his/her own process, offering energetic support wich can sometimes include (with previous consent) physical touches on certain parts of the body. Each session is unique. The energy interacts with each person differently, according to what is needed in the moment. This is a safe process where the participant remains conscious of himself/herself at all times. In some people the energy may result in more 'obvious' manifestations like spontaneous mouvements, spasms, various physical sensations or emotions; or it may take on a more introspective form, with images, deep feelings of peace and calm, insights and intuition... Benefits: Increase in vitality Liberation of stuck emotions and blockages Empowerment Clarity and mental peace Deeper presence and connection to one's self Expanded states of consciousness Increase in intuition and creativity Awakening of sexual energy Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question or would like more information! @sandra_inresonance ***",

  "description": "Las Constelaciones Familiares son un abordaje terapeutico que permite entender mejor las relaciones dentro de las familias . Este método ayuda a identificar las dinámicas inconscientes que tienen su raíz en el sistema familiar y que causan malestar y conflicto en otros ámbitos de la vida : las relaciones personales, familia, pareja, salud, sexo, dinero, etc… Al hacerlas conscientes, de un modo ágil y eficiente te permiten mejorar el presente y avanzar en tu vida . Los niños rara vez o nunca se atreven a vivir una vida más feliz o más satisfactorio que sus padres. Sin darse cuenta que permanecen fieles a las tradiciones familiares tácitas que trabajan de forma invisible. Las Constelaciones Familiares son una forma de descubrir los lazos familiares subyacentes y las fuerzas que se han llevado inconscientemente lo largo de varias generaciones . Bertold Ulsamer. El beneficio de asistir a una Constelación Familiar no es únicamente para la persona que constela y para su sistema familiar, también es para las personas representantes. Los menores de 18 deberán venir acompañados de su tutor legal. Ofrecemos unas sesiones de Constelaciones Familiares en Poblenou en los siguientes miércoles: Marzo: 20 marzo, de 18.00 h a 20.30 h. Abril: 24 de abril, de 18.00 h a 20.30 h. Precio es: 55€ por constelar y 20€ por participante. Ubicación: Vivir Mejor es Posible- Carrer Joncar, 19, 3-1, 08005 Barcelona Maat Laam es una consteladora familiar con formación multidisciplinar en el ámbito energético y emocional. Además de ser Consteladora Familiar, también es Terapeuta Gestalt y cuenta con formación en sabiduría de los pueblos nativos.

  "description": "En el whitepaper de Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto describe el nuevo sistema como un sistema entre pares, Peer-to-Peer en inglés. Gracias a su invención y descubrimiento, hoy en día tenemos un dinero descentralizado y a prueba de censura, tal y como soñaban los Cypherpunks de los 90’. Pero el dinero es solo la punta del iceberg. En el meetup de Marzo, os presentamos Vexl, una aplicación FOSS de comercio entre pares que busca expandir el sueño de Satoshi mas allá de solo el dinero descentralizado. Desde comprar y vender BTC P2P a ofrecer servicios u otros objetos. Vexl propone una economía circular y descentralizada para liberarnos de los últimos zarpazos del estado. Usaremos el formato de debate Fishbowl para compartir y debatir todo lo que Vexl puede aportar a la comunidad Bitcoin. Además, vamos a estrenar las Tómbolas Lightning Network. ¡Prepárate para ganar premios que te sorprenderán! https://vexl.it Contaremos con los co-fundadores de Vexl: Grafton - @Satsdisco - idioma inglés Lea - @LeaPetras - idioma inglés 🚨 Queremos dejar claro que se trata de un meetup de carácter técnico, no tratamos temas relacionados con la especulación o la valoración de Bitcoin en el mercado. No hablaremos sobre valoraciones económicas futuras de esta u otras monedas digitales. La asistencia a este acto es libre y gratuita.

Dive into the specifics of RAG, covering its different variants (naive, advanced, and modular) and illustrating their indexing and querying phases. Navigate through practical challenges, addressing issues in reading, parsing, embedding, and querying, offering innovative solutions for effective implementation. Explore essential extras such as guardrails and evaluation metrics, enhancing your understanding of LLMs and RAG for transformative business data reasoning. All are spiced with insights from our journey, with ample room for a dynamic Q&A session and of course our networking with food and drinks.

If you've never worked with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, please complete at least part of an introductory course like fast.ai before signing up. Check the chat for this event on Meetup if you need help finding the group. ===== Let's talk about what each of us has been studying or working on. If you're not already working with or studying AI, why not start a project? Here are a few ideas: Complete part of a course like fast.ai Read a book or paper Complete a tutorial Build something that uses an API Train or fine-tune a model Do something with inference on a model … The project I'll be working on is using text embeddings for search in an iOS app. If you can't attend, please change your status so that others can attend in case the event is full.",

Las aventuras de la China Iron es una refundación radical del Martín Fierro, clásico de la literatura gauchesca argentina, el «poema nacional». Aquí, la protagonista es la China —sí ahora con mayúscula— que deja de ser «su» china. A Fierro lo reclutan, y ella aprovecha. Acompaña a Liz, una inglesa que va tras su marido también llevado por la leva. Pero la China no busca a Fierro. Ella escapa. Y en su viaje, descubre. Descubre placer, gozo, sexualidad. Descubre palabras, sonidos nuevos para cosas que antes no existían. Descubre el mundo. Sobre la autora Gabriela Cabezón Cámara es una escritora y periodista argentina. Es feminista y activista socioambiental. Publicó tres novelas — La Virgen Cabeza (2009), que le valió el reconocimiento de crítica y público, Las aventuras de la China Iron (2017), cuya versión al inglés traducida por Iona Macintyre y Fiona Mackintosh fue nominada al prestigioso Premio Booker Internacional, ​y Las niñas del naranjel (2023), sobre el personaje histórico de la Monja Alférez y la conquista de América—, dos novelas gráficas — Beya ( Le viste la cara a Dios ) (2013) y Y su despojo fue una muchedumbre (2015)— y las novelas cortas Le viste la cara a Dios (2011) y Romance de la Negra Rubia (2014).",

  "description": "Step into the world of playful transformation with me, your personal Life Coach! As we embark on this journey together, let's take a moment to remember what it felt like to play without a care in the world. My mission is to advocate for the gamification of life, infusing the busy lives of individuals with the rejuvenating power of play. Together, we'll rediscover the joy of simply being ourselves and tap into that childlike wonder that often gets lost as we grow older. It's a common observation that traits like playfulness, fun-seeking, uninhibitedness, and spontaneity tend to diminish as we distance ourselves from childhood. But here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way. Embracing playfulness not only expands our thinking but also fosters a deeper sense of self-awareness, compassion, and joy. As a Certified Mindvalley Life Coach, I'm dedicated to supporting your journey and helping you reconnect with your inner child. Play is not just reserved for kids—it's a fundamental aspect of human experience that we can benefit from throughout our lives. By embracing play, we create space for endless possibilities and new ways of thinking without the burden of stress entering our body. Together, we'll uncover the underlying motivations behind your thoughts and reframe them, empowering you to take tangible actions that propel you forward on your journey to personal growth and fulfillment. Are you ready to unlock the transformative power of play? Reach out to me today, and let's get started! As I'm just starting out in the field, I'm excited to offer free coaching sessions throughout March and April. I invite you to take advantage of this opportunity to experience coaching firsthand!

  "description": "Yin Yoga Yin yoga is an easy going, relaxing yoga style and by time you can make it more challenging for yourself. We focus on the deeper levels of the body; joints, ligaments, fascia and bones to make them stronger and more flexible even. Yin yoga removes the blockages deep in our connective tissues allowing the Chi/prana (life energy) to flow unhindered. Most forms of yoga today are dynamic, active practices designed to work only half of our body, the muscular half, the “yang” tissues. Yin Yoga allows us to work the other half, the deeper “yin” parts. Mentally Yin Yoga can be challenging at times because we stay in one pose for a few minutes focusing on the stillness of the body, stillness of the breath and stillness of the mind. Yin Yoga classes in English are held on Thursday evenings 8pm - 9pm at ElUp Studio, Carrer de Trafalgar 48. Prices: 11.50euros/class 65euros/6classes (this bundle via my website www.kittyroot.com)",

That's why we'll be using designated icebreaker cards — hoping a good question will be the tiny spark that ignites thoughts, ideas, and personal revelations. These cards are designed to foster deeper or more entertaining conversations than if you had simply asked, \"How are you?\" \"How was work?\" or \"Did you see that thing on the news?\" Everyone will pick a different question, and then take turns answering. Principles: Don't force anyone to talk about what they're not ready for Be fully present Take your time Genuinely listen Embrace the tangents",

Do you want to receive and offer encouragement, advice, and inspiration? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then join us for a special sharing circle in Ciutadella Park. This is a free and open event, where women of all backgrounds, ages, and experiences are welcome. A sharing circle is a simple and powerful way to create meaningful connections and foster mutual support. We will sit in a circle, and each person will have the opportunity to speak from the heart, without interruption or judgment. We will listen with compassion and respect, and honor each other’s confidentiality and privacy. This is not a therapy session, but a peer-to-peer exchange of stories, feelings, and perspectives. We hope that by sharing our struggles and successes, we will feel less alone, more empowered, and more hopeful. To join us, please register here and bring a blanket or a cushion to sit on. The event will last for about an hour and a half, but you are free to leave at any time. Disclaimers: 📸 By attending, you permit us to capture the wonderful moments through photos and/or videos to share on our social media. 🌟 Please remember, this is a space created by women, for women, and mutual respect is at the heart of our community. We take this premise very seriously, ensuring everyone feels safe and empowered. We look forward to seeing you there!",

Per tal d’aconseguir que les comunicacions entre nosaltres siguin més àgils, es crearà un grup de WhatsApp exclusivament per a aquesta trobada, que s’obrirà unes hores abans i es tancarà unes hores després de la trobada. Si esteu interessats en ser agregats, si us plau, feu-nos arribar el vostre: 1 - Nom 2 - Cognom 3 - Número de telèfon Mitjançant un missatge privat a l’organitzador. Si falta alguna d’aquestes tres coses o el número de telèfon no té WhatsApp, no et podrem afegir al grup. Totes les persones integrants del grup de WhatsApp disposaran d’ubicació en directe durant el transcurs d’aquest Meetup. Un cop apuntats, si finalment, pel motiu que sigui, no podeu venir, agrairem que us doneu de baixa. Durant el recorregut, no hi ha garanties de que es contestin les trucades, ni tampoc els missatges, estarem massa enfeinats fent fotos. Durant el recorregut, cadascú de nosaltres serà responsable de no perdre el grup, no obstant, si algú es perd, ens podrem retrobar més tard al lloc on haurem quedat prèviament. Al finalitzar, per a la gent que vulgui, hi haurà l’opció d’anar a prendre alguna cosa en alguna terrassa, parlar, veure les fotos que hem fet, etc. QUE FAREM: Abans de res aclarir que això no és una classe, ni un curs, ni tampoc un taller de fotografia. Això és una trobada de gent interessada en la fotografia urbana, de carrer, una trobada de gent interessada en les ciutats, en les persones que hi viuen i en les activitats que s’hi fan. Passejarem pels carrers de la ciutat a la recerca de les coses que ens puguin agradar, interessar, sorprendre, anirem a la recerca de la bellesa. Al mateix temps, la trobada també ens permetrà conèixer gent amb la mateixa afició que nosaltres i podrem intercanviar idees, impressions i coneixements. No cal portar un gran equip, n’hi haurà prou amb una càmera petita que ens permeti passar desapercebuts i no ser gaire invasius. Cadascú podrà fer servir la tècnica fotogràfica que més li convingui en cada moment. Tothom és benvingut, gent de totes les edats, des de principiants fins a experts. És gratuït, només es demana una mica d’entusiasme. Ens ho passarem molt bé! BENVINGUTS!",

Al terminar, realizaremos un cierre grupal donde compartiremos lo vivido y aprendido. De forma opcional y fuera ya de la actividad principal, quien quiera podrá ir a tomar algo por la zona. Aportación nuevos miembros: 18 Euros. Aportación miembros comunidad Slowdating: 15 Euros. Aportación \"trae un amigo/a\": 28 Euros para 2 personas.

There may have been many times in your life where didn't feel safe to express your emotions and especially anger. You may have suppressed your anger your whole life. ✨When we start healing and start noticing anger it can be quite scary and we might not know what to do with all this built up energy and end up storing it all in our bodies Causing dis- ease and denying our Authentic self. In this workshop and circle we will look at creative ways where we can release anger in a healthy way and how we can use these tools in everyday life. ✨Anger is not usually accepted in our society so usually we repress it or project it on to others. 🌸Anger is a natural, healthy emotion and when we start to accept it and allow ourselves to express it , it can be very freeing and healing. ✨So if you feel you need a release , want to share your story , learn new tools and connect with other women on their healing journey come and join us 💗🙏 Looking forward to it and cant wait to share with you 💗 🌸For more info and to sign up message me on WhatsApp Davina - +34604188328",
